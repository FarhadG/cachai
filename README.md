# Cachai

**Cachai** is a novel AI/ML system that optimizes your cache. Cachai? 

The word "Cachai" is inspired by the Chilean word "cachai", meaning "you get it?" or "understand?".

Cachai aims to intelligently manage caching strategies for improved efficiency, balancing cache hits, minimizing stale data, and adapting to dynamic environments.

## Why Cachai?
Modern systems require smart and adaptive caching to handle dynamic workloads. Cachai is built to go beyond traditional static caching strategies, applying advanced machine learning models to predict optimal caching policies, thus ensuring high performance and resource efficiency.
